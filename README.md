# cv-template
Template for a CV/resume in LaTeX.

The pdf of the thesis can be produced by running `make`.
For the creation of the pdf file, you need a distribution of TeX, such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html).
An alternative is to use an online LaTeX editor, such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
